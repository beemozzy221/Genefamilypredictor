# Genefamilypredictor
Machine learning model for predicting gene families. 
This is an extremely rudimentary implementation of machine learning techniques to predict gene families. The implementation is so straightforward to understand and implement that not even libraries which are specialized for these kind of tasks are used, save a few very common libraries that are usually used for these tasks like numpy library. This repository is meant to provide an introduction to the basic techniques that are associated with the implementation of mahcine learning to biological data and as a introduction to machine learning as a whole.
That being said, any improvements to the currently tested accuracy are always welcome. Feel free to browse through the file "neualnets" that consist of the model (feedforward NN) and mainfile which consist of hardcodes for the location of nucleotide sequences.
The file named "encoder" is meant to preprocess the nucleotide files that are to be fed to the model.
File "filereader" implemented in the mainfile, simply reads the file.
